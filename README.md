# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


### Plan for design:  
    [ ] Build out Navbar component to be used for each render
    [ ] Build out Footer component to be used for each render
    [ ] Design HomePage page
    [ ] Design GithubPage page
        [ ] Page should list 4 most recently created repositories. Listing:
        - Repo Name,
        - Repo Link,
        - Created Date,
        - Latest Commit Date,
        - Latest Commit Message
        [ ] Toggle button to instead list 4 most recently updated repsoitories.
    [ ] Design ContactPage page
